In its broadest sense , every email sent to a potential or current customer could be considered email marketing . It usually involves using email to send advertisements , request business , or solicit sales or donations , and is meant to build loyalty , trust , or brand awareness . Marketing emails can be sent to a purchased lead list or a current customer database . The term usually refers to sending email messages with the purpose of enhancing a merchant 's relationship with current or previous customers , encouraging customer loyalty and repeat business , acquiring new customers or convincing current customers to purchase something immediately , and sharing third - party ads .    Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns .  Historically , it has been difficult to measure the effectiveness of marketing campaigns because target markets can not be adequately defined . Email marketing carries the benefit of allowing marketers to identify returns on investment and measure and improve efficiency . Email marketing allows marketers to see feedback from users in real time , and to monitor how effective their campaign is in achieving market penetration , revealing a communication channel 's scope . At the same time , however , it also means that the more personal nature of certain advertising methods , such as television advertisements , can not be captured .   Types  Email marketing can be carried out through different types of emails :   Transactional emails  Transactional emails are usually triggered based on a customer 's action with a company . To be qualified as transactional or relationship messages , these communications ' primary purpose must be `` to facilitate , complete , or confirm a commercial transaction that the recipient has previously agreed to enter into with the sender '' along with a few other narrow definitions of transactional messaging . Triggered transactional messages include dropped basket messages , password reset emails , purchase or order confirmation emails , order status emails , reorder emails , and email receipts .  The primary purpose of a transactional email is to convey information regarding the action that triggered it . But , due to their high open rates ( 51.3 % compared to 36.6 % for email newsletters ) , transactional emails are an opportunity to introduce or extend the email relationship with customers or subscribers ; to anticipate and answer questions ; or to cross-sell or up - sell products or services .  Many email newsletter software vendors offer transactional email support , which gives companies the ability to include promotional messages within the body of transactional emails . There are also software vendors that offer specialized transactional email marketing services , which include providing targeted and personalized transactional email messages and running specific marketing campaigns ( such as customer referral programs ) .   Direct emails  Direct email involves sending an email solely to communicate a promotional message ( for example , a special offer or a product catalog ) . Companies usually collect a list of customer or prospect email addresses to send direct promotional messages to , or they rent a list of email addresses from service companies . Safe mail marketing is also used .  Mobile email marketing Email marketing develops large amounts of traffic through smartphones and tablets . Marketers are researching ways to advertise to more users and to make them view advertising for longer . However , the rate of delivery is still relatively low due to better filtering - out of advertising and users having multiple email accounts for different purposes . Because emails are generated according to the tracked behavior of consumers , it is possible to send advertising which is based on the recipient 's behavior . Because of this , modern email marketing is perceived more often as a pull strategy rather than a push strategy .   Comparison to traditional mail  There are both advantages and disadvantages to using email marketing in comparison to traditional advertising mail .   Advantages  Email marketing is popular with companies for several reasons :    An exact return on investment can be tracked ( `` track to basket '' ) and has proven to be high when done properly . Email marketing is often reported as second only to search marketing as the most effective online marketing tactic .   Email marketing is significantly cheaper and faster than traditional mail , mainly because of the high cost and time required in a traditional mail campaign for producing the artwork , printing , addressing , and mailing .   Businesses and organizations who send a high volume of emails can use an ESP ( email service provider ) to gather information about the behavior of the recipients . The insights provided by consumer response to email marketing help businesses and organizations understand and make use of consumer behavior .   Email provides a cost - effective method to test different marketing content , including visual , creative , marketing copy , and multimedia assets . The data gathered by testing in the email channel can then be used across all channels of marketing campaigns , both print and digital .   Advertisers can reach substantial numbers of email subscribers who have opted in ( i.e. , consented ) to receive the email .   Almost half of American Internet users check or send email on a typical day , with emails delivered between 1 am and 5 am local time outperforming those sent at other times in open and click rates .   Email is popular with digital marketers , rising an estimated 15 % in 2009 to £ 292 million in the UK .   If compared to standard email , direct email marketing produces higher response rate and higher average order value for e-commerce businesses .    Disadvantages  As of mid-2016 email deliverability is still an issue for legitimate marketers . According to the report , legitimate email servers averaged a delivery rate of 73 % in the U.S. ; six percent were filtered as spam , and 22 % were missing . This lags behind other countries : Australia delivers at 90 % , Canada at 89 % , Britain at 88 % , France at 84 % , Germany at 80 % and Brazil at 79 % .  Additionally , consumers receive on average circa 90 emails per day .  Companies considering the use of an email marketing program must make sure that their program does not violate spam laws such as the United States ' Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act ( CAN - SPAM ) , the European Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 , or their Internet service provider 's acceptable use policy .   Opt - in email advertising  Opt - in email advertising , or permission marketing , is a method of advertising via email whereby the recipient of the advertisement has consented to receive it . This method is one of several developed by marketers to eliminate the disadvantages of email marketing .  Opt - in email marketing may evolve into a technology that uses a handshake protocol between the sender and receiver . This system is intended to eventually result in a high degree of satisfaction between consumers and marketers . If opt - in email advertising is used , the material that is emailed to consumers will be `` anticipated '' . It is assumed that the recipient wants to receive it , which makes it unlike unsolicited advertisements sent to the consumer . Ideally , opt - in email advertisements will be more personal and relevant to the consumer than untargeted advertisements .  A common example of permission marketing is a newsletter sent to an advertising firm 's customers . Such newsletters inform customers of upcoming events or promotions , or new products . In this type of advertising , a company that wants to send a newsletter to their customers may ask them at the point of purchase if they would like to receive the newsletter .  With a foundation of opted - in contact information stored in their database , marketers can send out promotional materials automatically using autoresponders -- known as drip marketing . They can also segment their promotions to specific market segments .   Legal requirements   Australia  The Australian Spam Act 2003 is enforced by the Australian Communications and Media Authority , widely known as `` ACMA '' . The act defines the term unsolicited electronic messages , states how unsubscribe functions must work for commercial messages , and gives other key information . Fines range with 3 fines of AU $110,000 being issued to Virgin Blue Airlines ( 2011 ) , Tiger Airways Holdings Limited ( 2012 ) and Cellar master Wines Pty Limited ( 2013 ) .   Canada  The `` Canada Anti-Spam Law '' ( CASL ) went into effect on July 1 , 2014 . CASL requires an explicit or implicit opt - in from users , and the maximum fines for noncompliance are CA $ 1 million for individuals and $10 million for businesses .   European Union  In 2002 the European Union ( EU ) introduced the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications . Article 13 of the Directive prohibits the use of personal email addresses for marketing purposes . The Directive establishes the opt - in regime , where unsolicited emails may be sent only with prior agreement of the recipient ; this does not apply to business email addresses .  The directive has since been incorporated into the laws of member states . In the UK it is covered under the Privacy and Electronic Communications ( EC Directive ) Regulations 2003 and applies to all organizations that send out marketing by some form of electronic communication .   United states  The CAN - SPAM Act of 2003 was passed by Congress as a direct response of the growing number of complaints over spam e-mails . Congress determined that the US government was showing an increased interest in the regulation of commercial electronic mail nationally , that those who send commercial e-mails should not mislead recipients over the source or content of them , and that all recipients of such emails have a right to decline them . The act authorizes a US $16,000 penalty per violation for spamming each individual recipient . However , it does not ban spam emailing outright , but imposes laws on using deceptive marketing methods through headings which are `` materially false or misleading '' . In addition there are conditions which email marketers must meet in terms of their format , their content and labeling . As a result , many commercial email marketers within the United States utilize a service or special software to ensure compliance with the act . A variety of older systems exist that do not ensure compliance with the act . To comply with the act 's regulation of commercial email , services also typically require users to authenticate their return address and include a valid physical address , provide a one - click unsubscribe feature , and prohibit importing lists of purchased addresses that may not have given valid permission .  In addition to satisfying legal requirements , email service providers ( ESPs ) began to help customers establish and manage their own email marketing campaigns . The service providers supply email templates and general best practices , as well as methods for handling subscriptions and cancellations automatically . Some ESPs will provide insight and assistance with deliverability issues for major email providers . They also provide statistics pertaining to the number of messages received and opened , and whether the recipients clicked on any links within the messages .  The CAN - SPAM Act was updated with some new regulations including a no - fee provision for opting out , further definition of `` sender '' , post office or private mail boxes count as a `` valid physical postal address '' and definition of `` person '' . These new provisions went into effect on July 7 , 2008 .

The show , narrated by Future Ted , tells the story of how Ted Mosby met The Mother . Tracy McConnell appears in 8 episodes from `` Lucky Penny '' to `` The Time Travelers '' as an unseen character ; she was first seen fully in `` Something New '' and was promoted to a main character in season 9 . The Mother is played by Cristin Milioti .  The story of how Ted met The Mother is the framing device behind the series ; many facts about her are revealed throughout the series , including the fact that Ted once unwittingly owned her umbrella before accidentally leaving it behind in her apartment . Ted and The Mother meet at the Farhampton train station following Barney Stinson and Robin Scherbatsky 's wedding ; this scene is shown in `` Last Forever '' , the series finale . The Mother 's death from an unspecified terminal illness in 2024 , also revealed in the series finale , received a mixed reaction from fans .  An alternate ending was released in the ninth season DVD . In the alternate ending , Tracy Mosby is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 . In the video , future Ted is heard saying , `` ... When I think how lucky I am to wake up next to your mom every morning , I ca n't help but be amazed how easy it all really was ... '' , indirectly stating that The Mother is alive . The video ends right after the train passes at Farhampton station and credits start rolling , implying that Ted never went back to Robin as he lived a successful married life with Tracy Mosby .    During its first eight seasons , the successful sitcom How I Met Your Mother often hinted at the unseen character of The Mother . Well - known actresses often made guest appearances on the show . Many fans expected that another would play one of the most - wanted roles in Hollywood , but creators Carter Bays and Craig Thomas wanted an unknown . Using Anne Hathaway and Amy Adams as examples , Thomas said that `` We did n't want it to be a big famous star because we did n't want the wider audience to have associations with whatever actress this would be ... The whole idea is that Ted 's never seen this woman before , so it better feel that way to the audience '' , similar to how Cobie Smulders being cast as Robin Scherbatsky had `` kept the show alive '' when it began . Bays and Thomas also did not want a large casting call .  They chose Cristin Milioti after seeing her on 30 Rock and Once ; her musical ability was also helpful , as The Mother had been described as a band member . After competing for the role against at least two others , Milioti filmed her first scene -- for the last episode of season 8 -- having never watched How I Met Your Mother ; she recalled , `` I had ignorance on my side . So I did n't know what it meant . '' Milioti learned of the character 's importance only after binge watching the show during the summer .   Character history ( edit )  The Mother was born on September 19 , 1984 .  The Mother , joined by her roommate Kelly awaits the arrival of her boyfriend Max only to receive a call informing her of his death . After the funeral service , she returns to the apartment to open Max 's last gift to her -- a ukulele . The Mother spends the next few years grieving the passing of the man she believes was her one true love .  In `` Wait for It '' , it is revealed that the short story of how they met involved her yellow umbrella . In `` No Tomorrow '' , Ted finds the umbrella at a club and takes it home after attending a St. Patrick 's Day party which she also attended , as it had been two and a half years since the death of Max , her late boyfriend . She is still grieving , but her roommate Kelly encourages her to go out and date again , bringing her to the same bar where Ted and Barney are celebrating . The two women run into Mitch , her old orchestra instructor ; The Mother offers to give Mitch her cello for his work at a school and they head to her apartment . After they start talking , Mitch encourages her to pursue her dreams . The Mother expresses her desire to end poverty by taking up economics in college .  On his first day of teaching as Professor Mosby , as seen in the season 4 finale `` The Leap '' , he is seen in front of the classroom of students , one of which Future Ted says is the titular mother . But in the first episode of season 5 , `` Definitions '' , it is revealed that he was actually in the wrong classroom -- Economics instead of Architecture . At the same time in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , the Mother sits her first session in Economics 305 and meets another graduate student named Cindy ( Rachel Bilson ) , whom she offers to move in with her as her roommate . They see Ted enter the room , but when he announces the subject , The Mother thinks she is in the wrong room and runs off . She heads back to the room after seeing Ted scramble to his actual classroom .  Later , in `` Girls Versus Suits '' , Ted dates Cindy , not knowing that her roommate is his future wife . Throughout the episode , Ted notes that Cindy had spent most of their first date talking jealously about her roommate . When in Cindy and the mother 's apartment he picks up many of The Mother 's belongings , attempting to show how compatible he and Cindy are ( thinking the items are Cindy 's ) and glimpses the mother 's foot as she disappears into her room after taking a shower . Ted finds out at this time that she plays bass guitar in a band . Ted forgets to take the yellow umbrella with him when he goes out and Future Ted mentions , `` this is how your mother got her yellow umbrella back . '' In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is revealed that , after Ted left the apartment , the Mother had discovered the umbrella and , upon going to question Cindy , finds her in a state . As she tried to console her , Cindy said that she was a much better match for Ted , and began to lovingly list all of the reasons that Ted would find the mother attractive , before spontaneously kissing her , revealing that her jealousy towards her roommate was actually a crush . While this incident made Cindy realise that she is a lesbian , it also made the Mother decide to go back into dating , as the kiss was her first in a long time .  Some time after this , a man named Darren approaches The Mother and is welcomed into her band named Superfreakonomics . Darren gradually takes over the band .  In the season 6 opener `` Big Days '' it is revealed Ted meets his future wife `` the day of '' the wedding at which he is the best man . In the episode `` False Positive '' Robin asks Ted to be her future best man , should she ever get married . In the episode `` Challenge Accepted '' , it is revealed that Ted meets the mother of his children the day of Barney 's wedding . In the last episode of season 7 , `` The Magician 's Code '' it is shown that Barney will marry Robin , and Ted will meet the mother `` the day of '' their wedding . On the premiere of season 8 , Ted 's wife appears after Barney and Robin 's wedding , outside at the `` Farhampton '' station while holding a yellow umbrella and her bass guitar .  In the season 8 episode `` Band or DJ ? , '' Ted runs into Cindy on the subway and tells her that the band Barney and Robin hired to play at their wedding cancelled at the last minute . The end result of the encounter is that Cindy 's ( now ex - ) roommate 's band plays at Barney and Robin 's wedding .  The Mother is first shown meeting Louis in `` How Your Mother Met Me '' as she is left to carry the band equipment while the now - lead band member Darren talks to his fans . Later at MacLaren 's Pub , she tells him she 's not yet ready to date . Louis asks her to give him a call if she changes her mind and they begin dating not long after .  The Mother meets all of Ted 's best friends ( Barney , Lily , Marshall and Robin ) before she meets him . The Mother is responsible for convincing Barney to pursue Robin , as revealed through a flashback in `` Platonish '' . In `` The Locket '' , Tracy meets Lily on a train journey .  In `` Bass Player Wanted '' , the Mother picks up a hitchhiking Marshall , carrying his son Marvin , on her way to Farhampton Inn . On their way , it is revealed that the Mother is a bass player in the band , that is scheduled to play at the wedding reception . But the band 's leader , Darren , forced her to quit . The Mother ultimately decides to confront Darren and retake the band . She ends up alone at the bar , and while practicing a speech to give Darren , Darren walks up to her furious the groom 's best man punched him for `` no reason . '' Amused by this , the Mother laughs , and Darren quits the band in anger .  In `` How Your Mother Met Me '' , it is shown that after this incident , the Mother returns to Louis ' summer cottage not far from the Farhampton Inn where she has been staying for the duration of the wedding weekend . As she walks in the door , Louis proposes to her , but she goes outside to think about it for a few minutes . She declines Louis ' proposal and leaves his cottage , going to check in at Farhampton Inn . On her room 's balcony , she plays the ukulele and sings `` La Vie en Rose '' . Ted hears her singing from his room next door .  In `` Gary Blauman '' , Ted and the Mother are on their first date . Ted picks her up at her New York City apartment and they proceed to walk to a Scottish - Mexican fusion restaurant for dinner . On the way there , Ted is telling her a story when they nearly have a run - in with Louis . She says that she is in the `` weirdest place on earth '' right now and that it is too soon for her to be dating . Ted walks her back to her apartment . They say goodnight and Ted begins to walk away . The Mother then stops him and asks him to finish the story he was telling her . When the story is over , they say goodnight again . The Mother takes a step towards Ted and they kiss for the first time , before deciding to carry on their date .  In a flashforward in `` The Lighthouse '' , Ted proposes to the Mother at the top of the lighthouse near Farhampton Inn . She immediately accepts . In another flashfoward in `` Unpause '' , the Mother is revealed to be pregnant with their second child , Luke , in the year 2017 . She goes into labor while she and Ted are staying at Farhampton .   Name ( edit )  The Mother 's real name is not revealed until the series finale , `` Last Forever '' . When Ted meets her at the Farhampton train station , she reveals that her name is Tracy McConnell . In the season 1 episode `` Belly Full of Turkey '' , Ted meets a stripper named Tracy and says `` ... that , kids , is the true story of how I met your mother '' . The children react in surprise and appear to believe Ted before he admits he is joking , which led some fans to correctly guess that The Mother 's name is Tracy .   Death ( edit )  See also : Last Forever In the series finale , it is revealed that six years prior to Ted telling the story to his children , Tracy died in 2024 from an undisclosed illness . In the finale the characters do not directly state that the mother is dead . Ted says that she `` became sick '' and his children saying that she has been `` gone '' for six years . Many fans expressed considerable disappointment to The Mother 's death . Milioti cried when she learned her character was supposed to die , but came to accept the ending was what the writers had planned from the beginning . Bill Kuchman from Popculturology said that The Mother was `` an amazing character '' and that `` over the course of this final season HIMYM made us care about Tracy . Kuchman said that `` asking fans to drop all of that with a simple line about The Mother getting sick and passing away was a very difficult request '' , that the finale `` advanced too quickly '' and that `` HIMYM was a victim of its own success on this issue '' .  A petition was started , aiming to rewrite and reshoot the finale . The petition has over 20,000 signatures and considerable online news coverage . On April 5 , 2014 , Carter Bays announced on Twitter that an alternate ending would be included on the Season 9 DVD . No new material was shot for this scene . In the alternate ending , the mother is still living when Ted is telling the story in 2030 .   Notes ( edit )    Jump up ^ The Mother celebrates her 21st birthday on the day that `` Pilot '' is set .

She was trained at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris and has appeared in such films as Loup ( 2009 ) , Sleepless Night ( 2011 ) and Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) . She plays the role of Mantis in the film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) .    Pom Klementieff was born in Quebec City , Quebec , Canada , to a Korean mother and French - Russian father , who was working there as a consul with the French government . She had a brother who committed suicide . Her parents chose the name `` Pom '' because it is similar in pronunciation to the Korean words for both `` spring '' ( 봄 ) and `` tiger '' ( 범 ) . Klementieff lived in Canada for one year before her family traveled extensively due to her father 's job , and she lived in Japan and the Ivory Coast before settling in France . Klementieff later said that travelling at an early age gave her a `` gypsy soul '' .  Klementieff 's father died of cancer when she was 5 , and her mother was schizophrenic and unable to care for children , so Klementieff was raised by her paternal uncle and aunt . Her uncle , whom she described as `` like my second father '' , died on her 18th birthday . Klementieff briefly attended law school after her uncle 's death to appease her aunt , but did not find the career path appealing . She also worked as a waitress and saleswoman in France . She started acting at age 19 at the Cours Florent drama school in Paris . A few months into her education , she won a theater competition that awarded her free classes for two years with the school 's top teachers .   Career ( edit )  Klementieff in 2018 Klementieff 's first professional acting job was the French independent film Après lui ( 2007 ) , portraying the stepdaughter of the protagonist played by Catherine Deneuve . Filming for her scenes took three days . During one scene , Klementieff was supposed to push someone down a set of stairs but accidentally fell down the stairs herself , and director Gaël Morel kept that shot in the final film . Her first leading role was in Loup ( 2009 ) , a French film about a tribe of reindeer herders in the Siberian mountains . During filming , Klementieff stayed in a camp , hours from the nearest village , where temperatures dropped well below zero . During filming she befriended nomads who lived there , worked with real wolves , rode reindeer , and swam with a horse in a lake .  Klementieff made her Hollywood debut in Spike Lee 's Oldboy ( 2013 ) , a remake of the South Korean film of the same name . She portrayed Haeng - Bok , the bodyguard of the antagonist played by Sharlto Copley . A fan of the original film , Klementieff heard about the part through Roy Lee , a producer with the remake , and took boxing lessons after learning the role involved martial arts . After showcasing her boxing skills during her audition , Lee asked her to go home and come back wearing a more feminine outfit and make - up , like her character in the film . She contributed some of her own clothes to the character 's wardrobe , and trained three hours a day for two months for an on - screen fight with star Josh Brolin . Klementieff came up with the name Haeng - Bok , Korean for `` happiness '' , herself after Lee asked her to research possible names for the character .  Klementieff moved to Los Angeles after Oldboy was filmed and began pursuing more Hollywood auditions . She continued taekwondo after the film , and has a purple belt as of the summer of 2014 . Her next acting role was the film Hacker 's Game ( 2015 ) , in which she plays a hacker she compared to Lisbeth Salander from the novel The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo . Klementieff used her boxing skills again in the film , and due to the movie 's low budget , she had to do her own make - up and chose her own wardrobe . It was her idea to dye her hair purple for the role , to which the directors first objected but later acquiesced . She joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe with her role as Mantis in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 ( 2017 ) and will appear in the same role in the film Avengers : Infinity War ( 2018 ) .
